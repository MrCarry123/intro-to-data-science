# Introduction to Data Science 

A repo for basic introduction to data analysis, science, and visualization. 

## Topics 

A major topic that will be visited over and over again is the concept of the **bias-variance tradeoff** and how it relates to model complexity. Nature is complex and convoluted. With Data Science, we are attempting to represent this extremely complex system with models that are slightly less complex. When we try to model every single part of Nature's complex systems, we make highly variant, low biased models. Total error of a model is a combination of variance and bias. Thus, to improve the model, we move towards reducing variance, increasing bias, and decreasing complexity.
