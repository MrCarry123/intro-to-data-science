    "# Introduction to Data Analysis with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been the go-to Data Science programming language for awhile now because of the vast number of packages written in it, its ease of use, and high readability. Python is considered an *easy* programming language to pickup - **low barrier of entry**. There are two reasons for this: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Quick Development** \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is installed on most Operating Systems and you can start developing in it in 1 line. For example, on *any* Mac / Apple open the native *Terminal* app, type **\"Python\"**, hit enter, and you are in a Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Python Code is VERY similar to pseudocode** \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot less syntax and convoluted computer science things going on on the surface. This makes Python code only slightly different from pseudocode. This is what makes a lot of people say that Python is a very easy first programming language to learn. There is a whole mess of things under the hood, but the product on the surface that people see looks very clean and concise. "
